# html_and_ai

A series of interesting and useful HTML wrappers that populate images, links, and youtube videos based off  a Javascript array that looks like: 

            const imageDictionary = new Map([
                ["First", "images/image1.png"],
                ["2", "images/image2.png"],
                ["1a", "back cut then alley hoop, https://youtu.be/J_gwhtU7FbU?si=A6t_zpIvxUGX3Q-e&t=184"],
                ["7", "bach guitar"],
                ["8", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33NQv3EX2QI"]
            ]);
